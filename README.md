# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this project I have been tasked with creating a weather dashboard that would return the current day's weather and the 5-day forecast.

The application also needed to have the functionality to save the entered cities and display them for quick navigation.

I have utilised my newly acquired skills of making API calls using jQuery and getting the necessary data to achieve the goals of the task.
